Built a Logistic Regression model on healthcare data to predict outcomes using standard ML preprocessing and evaluation techniques.
The model achieved an accuracy of 88.52%, demonstrating strong baseline performance.
This project highlights the effectiveness of classical machine learning models in healthcare prediction tasks.
